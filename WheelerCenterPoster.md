- 1801033 100nM = No Repeat, X u69 between
- 1711282 10nM = Repeat, OK experiment
- 1711281 10nM = Repeat; workable experiment
- 1711271 high dose, 2nd app crap
- 1709212 100nM = No Repeat, Great experiment
- 1709181 100nM = SS dont use
- 1709123 1nM = repeated effect, excitation not best example
- 1709121 100nM = repeated effect, Great experiment
- 1708303 10uM = decrease response check, 
- 1708301 10uM = no repeat, 2nd app crap
- 1708213 50nM = decrease response
- 1708212 500nM = repeat chek
- 1708091 1uM = repeat check
- 1707262 10uM = decrease response
- 1707251 5uM = no repeat

Dose | yes | No
10nM | III | O
>100 | I  | II

Turned out that the one that repeated in >100 group was Ih+ and the ones that did not repeat were Ih-
